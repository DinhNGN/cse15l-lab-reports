# Lab Report 1 - Remote Access
     *This post serves as a 3-step tutorial to log into course-specific account on ieng6!*
- The first step requires you to install VScode. This step was rather hastened for me as CSE11 had
required the installation & setup of a VScode already. Once installed, you'll see something like this:

- The next, second step to this tutorial would be creating a remote connection to reach a
remote computer where we can test/utilize commands. This process classifies your accessing
computer as 'client' & the remotely accessed computer as 'server'. Commands are written from
your device to be retrieved & processed remotely by the server. In this case we'll be using the
account associated with the UCSD server, & utilizing our UCSD account password to successfully
connect. Successful connection should have your terminal looking like this:

- Our final step would be testing commands associated with remote access. These commands are
typed in our terminal after successful remote connection. Commands such as "cd", "ls", &
"ls -a". Below demonstrates command "ls -a" which "lists all" content of the working directory,
including the hidden content of the directory:
