- The example above calls on the handleRequest method. In this method, the program would evaluate the contents of the path following "/". Since there exists
more to the path than just ending at "/", the program will evaluate what follows to check if it's a valid input for "/add-messages", & if is so & it contains
a valid input, the input will be returned & displayed on the page as shown.

- The example above much like the previous calls on the handleRequest method. In this method, the program would evaluate
the contents of the path following "/". Since there exists more to the path than just ending at "/", the program will evaluate what follows
to check if it's a valid input for "/add-messages", & if is so & it contains a valid input, the input will be returned & displayed on the page as shown.
