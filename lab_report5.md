# Lab Report 5 - Looking Back at "Researching Commands (find) -" (Lab Report 3)
### Part 1 - looking it Up

For this particular lab, I had started my research by picking a particular command that I find would be easy to understand how to use,
& secondly and possibly more importantly, something I would find useful. I started out by picking what command I wanted to do, & something came to mind right away,
the `find` command. The command was something I believe would be used very frequently, so I immediately decided on it. I started looking up commands by going through
two different routes, first I did what most people would do which is just chug it in [Google](Google.com) & pray that something pops up.

### Part 2 - Getting Confused

Honestly, I looked around at many different page that I thought would output the most useful find command. I first took a look at the [learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/find) page
through typing in the search key `find commands` into the Google search bar. Since the website was the first website that popped up & the title indicated that it was a
tutorial to find commands, I decided it was right. I utilized these commands in my terminal for the clone of the repository utilized in Skill Demo 1, & truth behold, the
tests weren't working as I had hoped & it took me a while of testing & experimenting until I simply decided that perhaps the commands weren't compatible with my compiler.
With this, I went through websites after websites, ranging from [howtogeek.com](https://www.howtogeek.com/771399/how-to-use-the-find-command-in-linux/) until eventually
I stumbled onto some useful websites.

### Part 3 - FINALLY WORKING

After being about 2 hours into working on my lab report, my research for the Holy Grail of a useful, easy to understand "find command" tutorial page finally hit home as I stumbled upon the [linuxize.com](linuxize.com) & [stackscale.com](stackscale.com)
pages for find commands. Through their page, I was able to find commands that allowed my to filter out the files & sub-directories in my clone, through commands such as
`find . -type d` that filtered out files of normal directory type. The two page in large part introduced similar commands that catergorized on size, file type, particular
name, etc.

### Part 4 - Deciding on Where to Use Commands

Going through the commands, I realized that the number of files shown through these command-line calls in the default directory introduced way too many files that would
obstruct the appeal that I was going for in my Markdown lab report. I decided that I would `cd` into branch directories that would provide an optimal amount of output
in the terminal so I could fit them in a smaller space. I did this by `cd`'ing into other directories, particularly the `skill-demo1-data`(`cd skill-demo1-data`) directory. If per say the
`skill-demo1-data` also yielded too many files, I would `cd` until I found an optima branch directory that would output a decently sized amount, but not too little hopefully.

### Part 5 - Final Touches

Finally being able to test & pick out what I wanted to use for my lab report 3, I collected every command-line I would use in my lab report into a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/?tgif=d), where I would
then look back to when I wrote down my Markdown lab report. To be really honest, I had to look back & forth between 3 tabs, one for specific Markdown edits that I wanted, one
for the Google Doc that I had written down commands I would use, & then the [Github](https://github.com/) where I would actually write my lab report. After some time writing down everything, I submitted
my assignmeny & that about concludes everything!
