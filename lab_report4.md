# Lab Report 4 - Lab 7 Competition Recreation (Steps 4 to 9)

## First Step (Step 4)~ Logging into ieng6 Account
- I opened the terminal & typed in "ssh" in the first available command-line. Following this, I press <Ctrl> + <R> simultaneously, & proceeded to enter "ie" until it showed up my UCSD username, "cs15lwi23aoh@ieng6.ucsd.edu", in the command-line & pressed <Enter>. Following this I entered my password when the prompt indicates to successfully gain access.

## Second Step (Step 5)~ Cloning Fork of Repository
- This step was straightforward,I went ahead and clicked on the linked page in the Week 7 Github, through "the lab 7 repo" link where I would click on "<> code" for a drop down. Through this drop down, I will click on the icon next to the URL in the drop down, to successfully copy the repository. Following this, I will type in the command, "git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7.git" to clone the repository onto the server.

## Third Step (Step 6)~ Compile & Run Test
- The steps to compile & run was simple. I accessed the javac compiler (javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java) by going 5 up in the search history, while the java command for running (java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamples.java) was 6 upo in the search history. (Keys pressed for compile: <up><up><up><up><up><enter>; Keys pressed for run: <up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>

## Fourth Step (Step 7)~ Fixing The Code
- To go into the code file to edit the code & fix it, we need to use type in "nano" followed by the file name, in this case, we would type in, "nano ListExamples.java". Once we have access to the code file, we will use the up, down, left & right arrow keys on our keyboard to navigate around. The problem is located at.

## Fifth Step (Step 8)~ Re-run & Re-compile Test

## Final Step (Step 9)~ Commit & Push Results
